# OpenCloud
Open Cloud is an open source implementation of common cloud services, meant to be ran on your hardware or servers. The goal is to allow for the agility, simplicity, and rapid development experience of the cloud without the hidden costs, ambiguity, or vendor lock in imposed by major cloud providers.

OpenCloud is meant to be flexible in the sense of where it can be ran, as is the intent. This can be any server you have access to, whether thats on-prem, or in the cloud. While you can reap the most benefits of OpenCloud by running it on-prem, it is also designed to be ran on cloud servers, which we recognize is much easier for individual developers.

## History
OpenCloud was a by-product of the [SnipSave](www.snipsave.com) team wanting the ease, agility and simplicity of the cloud, but their application not being able to afford the costs of the services they wanted to use. Hence, OpenCloud was developed by the SnipSave team to gain access to these services in a generalized way, and it was released to the public under the GPL-3.0 License.
