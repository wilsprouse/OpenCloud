# Frontend
This repo contains a working, example frontend.

Please note that this frontend code is an example, and you can easily provide your own frontend and use it as you please. The backend is agnostic to the frontend that is calling it.

Eventually this will be pure js/css/html. Live with it. #NoBuild
