# Service Ledger
One thing that OpenCloud tries to do differently is its approach to Infrastructure as Code (IaC). IaC is the practice of defining and managing infrastructure through code instead of manual setup, which makes environments reproducible, scalable, and consistent. However, it usually requires you to write and maintain code before deploying anything. OpenCloud flips this model: every action you take in the UI automatically generates and updates IaC behind the scenes, giving you all the benefits of reproducibility and portability without the overhead of writing the code first.

Introducing one of the core features of OpenCloud: The Service Ledger. The Service Ledger keeps track of your infrastructure's state <b>as you provision services in the UI</b>, and allows a developer to download a JSON that serves as the IaC of that OpenCloud instance. This makes it extremely easy to replicate and share OpenCloud configurations across environments.

In other words, every change you make in the OpenCloud UI, whether provisioning, updating, or removing resources, is automatically recorded in the Service Ledger. Instead of requiring you to write IaC, deploying, then checking the UI of your cloud provider to see if it was successful, OpenCloud reverses the process: It allows you to use the UI to get your infrastructure working, then you can easily download the resulting IaC for that configuration. This creates a living, always up-to-date representation of your infrastructure that can be used as your IaC.
